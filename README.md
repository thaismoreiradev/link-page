A link page project very inspired in Linktree service. It has a button to change wich a light & dark theme, with a soft ludical sky as background. I used react, so all links are components, it can be just few buttons or a lot, you just need change the props. (those are my real life links). For style I used tailwind, also react icons for sun and moon. I really loved this. [Check here the result!](https://thais-moreira-link-page.netlify.app/)
